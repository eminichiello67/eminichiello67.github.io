Hello!

My name is Emilio Minichiello, I am a mathematician working on categorical database theory at [Conexus AI](https://conexus.com/). 

I got my PhD in pure mathematics at the CUNY Graduate Center, studying the intersection of category theory and differential geometry. My thesis is composed of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11023) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09400), on applying homotopical and categorical methods to diffeological spaces. [Mahmoud Zeinalian](https://www.zeinalian.com/) was my advisor.

You can reach me best at [eminichiello67@gmail.com](mailto:eminichiello67@gmail.com).
