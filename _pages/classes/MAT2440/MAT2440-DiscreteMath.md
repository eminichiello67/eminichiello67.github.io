**Course Information:** In this course you'll start your journey as an applied mathematician. We'll learn how to prove mathematical statements, which is really what math is all about. We'll come to understand propositional logic and set theory, the basic language of all mathematics. Then we'll move on to analyzing basic algorithms and number theory. 

**Textbook:** Discrete Mathematics and its Applications, 8th edition by Kenneth H. Rosen (Sections 1 - 5)

**Grading:** 3 exams (15% each, 45% total), 1 final (25%), in-class quizzes (20%), class participation (10%).

**Homework:** I will not be collecting homework, but students should be expected to present their solutions to the class at the start of the next lecture.

**Student Wellness:** We all experience stressful and difficult events as a normal part of life. As your instructor, I
believe your mental health is an important part of your academic success. Success in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Be sure to check out the [Student Wellness Center](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/wellness-center/) and CityTech's [Counseling Services](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/counseling/).

**Academic Integrity:**
The instructor of the course has the authority to give a grade of F if the student submits the work of another person in a manner that
represents their work, or knowingly permits one’s work to be submitted by another person without the instructor’s permission. For further information see the [NYCCT Student Handbook](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/current-student/docs/StudentHandbook.pdf), pages 95-99.
