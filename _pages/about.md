Hello!

My name is Emilio Minichiello, I am a math PhD student at the CUNY Graduate Center, and my advisor is [Mahmoud Zeinalian](https://www.zeinalian.com/).

I also work part time at [Conexus AI](https://conexus.com/) doing research related to categorical database theory.

My work during my PhD has been at the intersection of Differential Geometry, Homotopy Theory and Category Theory. My focus has been on studying diffeological spaces using higher stacks. 

You can reach me best at [eminichiello67@gmail.com](mailto:eminichiello67@gmail.com).
