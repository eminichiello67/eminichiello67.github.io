## A-Homotopy Theory
<details>
    <summary>(2001) <strong>Foundations of a Connectivity Theory for Simplicial Complexes</strong> by Hélène Barcelo, Xenia Kramer, Reinhard Laubenbacher and Christopher Weaver.</summary>

  I consider this to be the first paper in A-homotopy theory, even though it is based off of papers by Atkins and his students, inspired by work in the social sciences on social dynamics, which are about what he calls Q-analysis of simplicial complexes. In this paper, Barcelo et al really get to work putting Atkins' idea on a a rigorous footing.
  <ul>
  <li>They define the A-homotopy group $A^q_n(\Delta, x_0)$ of a simplicial complex.</li>
  <li>They associate to every simplicial complex $$\Delta$$ a \(q\)-conectivity graph \(\Gamma^q(\Delta)\), whose vertices are the simplices of \(\Delta\) of dimension \(\geq q\) and whose edges connect those simplices which share a \(q\)-face. They define the \(A\)-homotopy groups of a graph \(A_n(G, x_0)\) such that \(A_n(\Gamma^q(\Delta), x_0) \cong A^q_n(\Delta, x_0)\).</li>
  </ul>
