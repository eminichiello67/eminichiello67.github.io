<p>Interestingly, subtleties appear immediately. The biggest one is: what do you mean by a graph?</p>

<p>There’s a ton of different notions of graphs, each with their own uses and conventions. For right now, I’m mainly interested in undirected graphs with at most one edge between two vertices and no loops. These kinds of graphs are often called <strong>simple graphs</strong>, and they seem (at least upon my beginner knowledge) to be slightly more central to algorithms and computer science than directed graphs, or graphs with multiple edges (also called multigraphs).</p>

<p>Now there’s quite a bit written about this zoo of kinds of graphs, such as the thesis <a href="https://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1986&amp;context=etd">The Categories of Graphs</a><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and this <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/graph">nlab page</a>, so I won’t talk too much about it. Here’s a table summarizing the graphs in the nlab article.</p>

<p><strong>Caveat:</strong> Pseudographs can have <em>multiple loops</em> on a vertex. We assume (directed) loop graphs can have at most <em>one</em> loop on a vertex.</p>

<p>Category theorists are probably most used to working with directed pseudographs, since categories are directed pseudographs with extra structure (identity loops and composition).</p>

<p>Right off the bat, let us note that the category \(\mathsf{DPGrph}\) of directed pseudographs is super nice. Indeed, if we let \((* \rightrightarrows *)\) denote the category with two objects \(E\) and \(V\) and two non-identity morphisms \(s, t : E \to V\), then a directed pseudograph is the same thing as a functor \(G : (* \rightrightarrows *) \to \mathbf{Set}\). Thus \(\mathsf{DPGrph} = \mathbf{Set}^{* \rightrightarrows *}\) is a Grothendieck topos, in particular it is a copresheaf category, really the nicest kind of category around. Doing any sort of construction in this category should be dumb simple, as (co)limits in copresheaf categories are computed objectwise<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>So let’s get into the math. By a simple graph \(G\), what I mean is a set \(V(G)\) of <strong>vertices</strong> equipped with a binary, irreflexive, symmetric relation \((E(G) \subseteq V(G)^2)\), called the <strong>edge relation</strong>. So if \(u,v \in V\), then \((u,v) \in E(G)\), which we will also write as \(uv\) or \(u \sim v\) if there is an edge connecting \(u\) and \(v\).</p>

<p>A map \(f: G \to G'\) of simple graphs is a function \(V(f): V(G) \to V(G')\) such that if \(uv \in E(G)\), then \(f(u)f(v) \in E(G')\). This gives us the category \(\mathsf{Grph}\) of simple graphs.</p>

<p>But wait…is this actually what we want? There’s a small, kind of annoying thing we notice right away from this definition. With the above definition, the two inclusions \(* \to [*-*]\) of a simple graph with one vertex and no edges into the simple graph with two vertices and one edge are morphisms, which is good. However, there is <strong>no</strong> morphism in the other direction \([*-*] \to *\). This is because if we call the first graph \(G\) with vertices \(u\) and \(v\) and the second graph \(G'\) with single vertex \(w\), then \(uv \in E(G)\), but since \(E(G')\) is irreflexive, \(ww \notin E(G')\). Thus the function sending \(u\) and \(v\) to \(w\) does not define a morphism of simple graphs.</p>

<p>So basically, with the most naive definition above, morphisms of simple graphs cannot collapse edges. Now this might be reasonable for your particular use case, but I don’t know, I’d like to consider some cases where you can collapse edges, that seems more natural and fun to me<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Alright, so let’s redo this. Lets redefine a simple graph \(G\) to consist of a set \(V(G)\) of vertices and a binary, <strong>reflexive</strong>, symmetric relation \((E(G) \subseteq V(G)^2)\). So technically, these are different mathematical objects. You might visualize them as undirected graphs with unique edges and where every vertex has exactly one loop. But this is kinda silly. I can’t map these loops to anything other than the unique loop where I send the underlying vertex to, so it might as well be like they aren’t there. It makes more sense to just identify these with the intuitive notion of a simple graph: undirected, unique edges, no loops, and just allow morphisms to collapse edges. Lets call the objects of \(\mathsf{Grph}\) just <em>graphs</em> from now on.</p>

<p>Let’s use the same notion we described as above for morphisms, and use the same name \(\mathsf{Grph}\). Okay, now this is a nice category. I can visualize its objects easily, its got a concrete mathematical description, and its got some nice morphisms. So let’s see how to compute some limits and colimits here.</p>

<p>Now if you check the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/category+of+simple+graphs">nlab page for simple graphs</a>, you’ll see a fancy result identifying \(\mathsf{Grph}\) as a Grothendieck quasitopos, which is a very nice category. For this post, let’s just do things by hand to get a feel for this category. But from this abstract result, we know that \(\mathsf{Grph}\) has all limits, colimits and is cartesian closed.</p>

<p>Note that making even small changes to this definition can have pretty drastic consequences categorically. For example, if we kept the definition before, where we weren’t allowed to smush edges, then we end up with a category that doesn’t even have all pushouts! See <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.01841">Spined Categories by Bumpus and Kocsis Page 7</a>.</p>

<p>Also note that Wikipedia considers for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_homomorphism">definition of graph homomorphism</a> to be loop graphs with maps between them that aren’t allowed to collapse loops or edges.</p>

<p>First off, lets notice there is a nice functor \(V : \mathsf{Grph} \to \mathbf{Set}\) that sends a graph to its set of vertices. If I have a map of graphs, then I get a map of their corresponding sets of vertices. This functor has a left adjoint \(\text{Disc} : \mathbf{Set} \to \mathsf{Grph}\) that sends a set \(S\) to the graph \(\text{Disc}(S)\), which has \(V(\text{Disc}(S)) = S\) and \(E(\text{Disc}(S)) = \varnothing\)<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>. In other words \(\text{Disc}(S)\) is the <strong>discrete graph</strong> on the set \(S\). Now \(V\) also has a right adjoint \(\text{CoDisc}: \mathbf{Set} \to \mathsf{Grph}\) which sends a set \(S\) to the graph \(\text{CoDisc}(S)\), whose set of vertices is \(S\), and where every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.</p>

<p>Okay, so \(V\) has left and right adjoints, so that means it preserves whatever (co)limits exist in \(\mathsf{Grph}\), and we know what (co)limits in \(\mathbf{Set}\) look like. So if we take a (co)imit \(\lim_i G_i\) of graphs, we know that \(V(\lim_i G_i) \cong \lim_i V(G_i)\). So that helps us guess what (co)limits should be in \(\mathsf{Grph}\).</p>

<p>Given graphs \(G\) and \(H\), let \(G \times H\) denote the graph with \(V(G \times H) = V(G) \times V(H)\) and \(E(G \times H) \subseteq V(G \times H)^2\) is the relation where \((g,h) \sim_{G \times H} (g',h')\) if \(g \sim_G g'\) and \(h \sim_H h'\). There are maps \(\pi_G : G \times H \to G\) in \(\mathsf{Grph}\), with \(\pi_G(g,h) = g\) and \(\pi_H : G \times H \to H\), with \(\pi_H(g,h) = h\).</p>

<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: \(G \times H\) is the product of \(G\) and \(H\) in the category \(\mathsf{Grph}\).</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong>: Suppose that we have maps \(g : Q \to G\) and \(h: Q \to H\). We want to define a map \(k : Q \to G \times H\) such that \(\pi_G k = g\) and \(\pi_H k = h\). Let \(k(q) = (g(q), h(q))\). Now this is a map of graphs, because if \(q \sim q'\), then \(g(q) \sim g(q')\) and \(h(q) \sim h(q')\) since \(g\) and \(h\) are maps of graphs, and so \(k(q) = (g(q), h(q)) \sim (g(q'),h(q')) = k(q')\). It is easy to check that this is the unique map such that \(\pi_G k = g\) and \(\pi_H k = h\), and hence is the categorical product. \(\square\)</p>

<p>Now let us try coproducts.</p>

<p>Given graphs \(G\) and \(H\), let \(G + H\) denote the graph with \(V(G + H) = V(G) + V(H)\) and \(E(G + H)\) is the relation where \(v \sim_{G + H} v'\) if \(v, v' \in G\) and \(v \sim_G v'\) or \(v,v' \in H\) and \(v \sim_H v'\). There are inclusion maps \(i_G : G \to G + H\) and \(i_H : H \to G + H\).</p>

<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: \(G + H\) is the coproduct of \(G\) and \(H\) in the category \(\mathsf{Grph}\).</p>

<p>The proof is the same idea as for products.</p>

<p>I’ll also leave it to you to check that \(\varnothing\), the graph with no vertices, is the intial object in \(\mathbf{Grph}\) and \(*\), the graph with one vertex, is the terminal object in \(\mathbf{Grph}\).</p>

<p>Now for pushouts. Given maps of graphs \(f: A \to B\) and \(g: A \to C\), let \(B+_A C\) denote the graph with \(V(B +_A C) = V(B) +_{V(A)} V(C)\), (i.e. \(V(B +_A C)\) is the set \(V(B) + V(C)\) quotiented by the equivalence relation \(\simeq\) where \(v \simeq w\) if there exist \(a \in V(A)\) such that \(v = f(a)\) and \(w = g(a)\)) and let \(E(B +_A C)\) be defined as follows. If \(x,y \in V(B +_A C)\), then \(x \sim_{B +_A C} y\) if there exists \(v,v' \in V(B)\) with \(v \sim_B v'\), \([v] = x\) and \([v'] = y\) or \(w,w' \in V(C)\) with \(w \sim_C w'\), \([w] = x\) and \([w'] = y\). In other words, there is an edge between \([v]\) and \([w]\) if there is some representative edge in \(B\) or \(C\).</p>

<p>There are maps \(i_B : B \to B+_A C\) and \(i_C : C \to B +_A C\) given by inclusion.</p>

\[\begin{CD}
 A @&gt;g&gt;&gt; C\\
 @VfVV @Vi_CVV \\
 B @&gt;i_B&gt;&gt; B+_A C
\end{CD}\]

<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: \(B+_A C\) is the pushout of \(f\) and \(g\) in \(\mathsf{Grph}\).</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong>: Suppose that we have maps \(n : B \to Q\) and \(m : C \to Q\) such that \(nf = mg\). We want to define a map \(k : B+_A C \to Q\) such that \(k i_B = n\) and \(k i_C = m\). On vertices, define it as you would in \(\mathsf{Set}\), i.e. send \(x \mapsto n(x)\) if \(x = [b]\) for some \(b \in B\) and \(x \mapsto m(x)\) if \(x = [c]\) for some \(c \in C\). If \([b] = [c]\), then there exists an \(a\in A\) with \(f(a) = b\) and \(g(a) = c\), so \(n(b) = nf(a) = mg(a) = m(c)\). So our map \(k\) is well defined. If \([v] \sim_{B+_A C} [w]\), then \(k[v] \sim_Q k[w]\), because in order for \([v] \sim [w]\), there has to be some representative of the edge in \(B\) or \(C\), and \(n\) and \(m\) preserve the edges of \(B\) and \(C\) respectively. Its now not hard to see that \(k\) satisfies the necessary properties for \(B +_A C\) to be a pushout.</p>

<p>Note that this is a generalization of the well-known <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique-sum">clique sum construction</a> in graph theory.</p>

<p>Finally, let’s look at pullbacks.</p>

<p>Given maps \(f : A \to B\) and \(g: A \to C\) of graphs, let \(B \times_A C\) denote the graph with \(V(B \times_A C) = V(B) \times_{V(A)} V(C)\) and with \(E(B \times_A C)\) defined as follows. We have \((b,c) \sim_{B \times_A C} (b',c')\) if \(b \sim_B b'\) and \(c \sim_C c'\).</p>

<p><strong>Lemma</strong>: \(B \times_A C\) is the pullback of \(f\) and \(g\) in \(\mathsf{Grph}\).</p>

<p><strong>Proof</strong>: Suppose we have maps \(n : Q \to B\) and \(m : Q \to C\) such that \(fn = gm\). We want to define a map \(k : Q \to B\times_A C\) such that \(\pi_B k = n\) and \(\pi_C k = m\). Well define \(k(q) = (n(q), m(q))\). Its now easy to check that since \(n\) and \(m\) preserve edges that \(k\) will as well, and it’s clearly unique and satisfies the required conditions.</p>

<p>So the basic categorical constructions for \(\mathsf{Grph}\) are pretty straightforward and nice. It would be interesting to compare this to all these other kinds of categories of graphs!</p>

<hr />

<p>Fun aside that I haven’t really thought through too much: If we consider the category \(\mathsf{orGrph}\), whose objects are simple graphs with an ordering on their vertices, then we get a cosimplicial object \(K^\bullet : \mathsf{\Delta} \to \mathsf{orGrph}\) given by the cliques and inclusion or collapse maps between them. Anytime we have such a cosimplicial object in a cocomplete category, we get an adjunction \(\text{Re}: \mathsf{sSet} \rightleftarrows \mathsf{orGrph} : \text{Sing}\). In this case, if \(G\) is a graph, then \(\text{Sing}(G)\) is a simplicial set gotten by mapping cliques into \(G\). The homotopy type of \(\text{Sing}(G)\) is thus the same as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_complex">clique complex</a> of \(G\). Neat! Then \(\text{Re}\) is like gluing cliques together according to a simplicial set “recipe.”</p>

Before we do that, we need some preliminary notions.</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong>: A <strong>cartesian space</strong> is a finite dimensional smooth manifold diffeomorphic to \(\mathbb{R}^n\) for some \(n \geq 0\). Given a set \(X\), a <strong>parametrization</strong> is a set function \(p : U \to X\) where \(U\) is a cartesian space. If \(M\) is a finite dimensional smooth manifold, and \(\mathcal{U} = \{ U_i \subseteq M \}\) is a collection of subsets of \(M\), we say that \(\mathcal{U}\) is a <strong>good open cover</strong> if each \(U_i\) is a cartesian space, every finite intersection \(U_{i_0} \cap \dots \cap U_{i_n}\) is either empty or a cartesian space, and \(\bigcup_i U_i = M\).</p>

<p><strong>Definition</strong><sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>: Given a set \(X\), a <strong>diffeology</strong> \(\mathcal{D}_X\) on \(X\) consists of a set of parametrizations \(p: U \to X\) satisfying the following three conditions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>All parametrizations with domain \(\mathbb{R}^0\) belong to \(\mathcal{D}_X\), namely all the points of \(X\),</li>
  <li>If \(p : V \to X\) is a parametrization, and \(f: U \to V\) is a smooth map between cartesian spaces, then the composition \(p \circ f\) belongs to \(\mathcal{D}_X\),</li>
  <li>If \(p: U \to X\) is a parametrization, \(\mathcal{U} = \{ U_i \subseteq U \}\) is a good open cover of \(U\) and \(p \vert_{U_i} \in \mathcal{D}_X\) for every \(U_i \in \mathcal{U}\), then \(p \in \mathcal{D}_X\).
If \(\mathcal{D}_X\) is a diffeology, then we call a parametrization \(p : U \to X\) that belongs to \(\mathcal{D}_X\) a <strong>plot</strong>. A <strong>diffeological space</strong> consists of a pair \((X, \mathcal{D}_X)\) of a set equipped with a diffeology.</li>
</ol>

<p>Given two diffeological spaces \((X, \mathcal{D}_X)\) and \((Y, \mathcal{D}_Y)\), a <strong>smooth map</strong> between them consists of a set function \(f : X \to Y\) such that if \(p : U \to X\) is a plot of \(X\), namely \(p \in \mathcal{D}_X\), then the composite map \(U \xrightarrow{p} X \xrightarrow{f} Y\) is a plot of \(Y\). Let \(\mathsf{Diff}\) denote the category of diffeological spaces with smooth maps.</p>

<p>Notice how simple these definitions are compared to the corresponding definitions of a smooth manifold! Really think about it, the definition of a manifold is really complicated. Its a kind of topological space (Hausdorff, second-countable), and it has all of these charts, which are homeomorphisms from cartesian spaces, and those charts have to be compatible in some way that’s really annoying to write symbolically, and then we consider the biggest collection (maximal atlas) of such charts compatible with the ones you’ve got, and then you call that a smooth structure. Okay, maybe if you are a seasoned differential geometer it isn’t so bad, but I remember spending <em>months</em> understanding the definition of a smooth manifold the first time I learned about it. There are so many nooks and crannies to get stuck on it. The definition of a diffeological space however, by comparison is clean and tidy. Same for the definition of smooth map.</p>

<p>Okay, that’s nice and all, but its just a definition. I can define whatever the hell I want, but its only interesting if it connects with things I care about. Well, suppose that \(M\) is a finite dimensional smooth manifold in classical differential geometry. Then we can consider the set \(\mathcal{D}_M\) of those parametrizations \(p : U \to M\) that are smooth as maps of smooth manifolds, in the sense of classical differential geometry. It turns out that \(\mathcal{D}_M\) satisfies the axioms of a diffeology. In other words, every finite dimensional smooth manifold is canonically a diffeological space. We call this the <strong>manifold diffeology</strong> on \(M\).</p>

<p>Even more powerfully, a function \(f: M \to N\) between finite dimensional smooth manifolds is smooth in the classical sense if and only if it is a smooth map in the sense of diffeological spaces between \(M\) and \(N\) equipped with their manifold diffeologies! This is proven in the <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Diffeology/Nb0xAAAAQBAJ?hl=en">diffeology textbook</a> in Article 4.3, and it implies that assigning the manifold diffeology to a manifold defines a fully faithful functor from the category of finite dimensional smooth manifolds to the category of diffeological spaces.</p>

\[\mathcal{D}_{(-)} : \mathsf{Man} \hookrightarrow \mathsf{Diff}.\]

<p>Intuitively, this means that we lose nothing by considering manifolds as diffeological spaces via their manifold diffeology. We could also characterize finite dimensional smooth manifolds as those diffeological spaces which have local diffeomorphisms to a fixed \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and satisfy some additional conditions.</p>

<p>I think this is a really powerful, and quite different way to think about smooth spaces. For smooth manifolds, we typically fix an atlas (a collection of compatible charts) and root around in the charts, making constructions and then checking that they are independent of the chart we chose. Much of the machinery of an introductory class in differential geometry is devoted to developing technology that hides the complexity of this “chartwise” thinking.</p>

<p>For diffeological spaces, we don’t think about charts at all. Instead we do constructions “plotwise.” It might not sound like we’ve really achieved all that much, just substituted chart for plot, but in doing so, we’ve actually obtained something really interesting and different.</p>

Note that this is a history very biased towards my interests in diffeology and leaves out many important developments in the theory.</p>

<ul>
  <li>(1973): Kuo-Tsai Chen wrote a <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1970846?origin=crossref">paper</a> where he introduced Chen spaces, a class of smooth spaces very similar to diffeological spaces, for the purpose of proving a “loop space deRham Theorem” (his words). This Theorem states that one can calculate the cohomology of the loop space of a manifold using a technique called “iterated integrals.” The important point here is being able to define differential forms on the loop space of a manifold, which is almost never a finite dimensional smooth manifold. While this is not directly relevant<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to diffeological spaces, it shows that such ideas about generalized smooth spaces were “in the air.”</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>(1980): Jean-Marie Souriau wrote a <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/bfb0089728">paper</a> where he introduced diffeological groups. His motivation was based in defining certain infinite dimensional smooth groups (such as groups of diffeomorphisms or symplectomorphisms) appearing in symplectic geometry.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>(1983): Souriau’s students Patrick Iglesias-Zemmour (PIZ) and Paul Donato write <a href="http://math.huji.ac.il/~piz/documents/EDGDFISLT.pdf">“Exemple de groupes différentiels : flots irrationnels sur le
tore”</a>, which studies what will become the most famous example of a diffeological space, the Irrational Torus. Later that year, Souriau gives the first general definition of a diffeological space in his paper <a href="http://math.huji.ac.il/~piz/documents-others/JMS-GDEPM-1983.pdf">“Groupes Differentiels Et Physique Mathematique”</a>.</li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(1988): PIZ writes a <a href="http://math.huji.ac.il/~piz/documents/BCCED.pdf">preprint</a> showing that there is an obstruction between Cech cohomology and deRham cohomology for diffeological spaces given by the diffeological principal \(\mathbb{R}\)-bundles with connection. It is never published.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(Late 1980s-2000s): PIZ develops a large amount of the theory of diffeological spaces in his thesis and several papers throughout this period. There are a couple of papers from other people, but overall not a large amount of activity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(2009): Baez and Hoffnung prove that diffeological spaces are precisely concrete sheaves on the site of open subsets of euclidean spaces in their paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1704">“Convenient Categories of Smooth Spaces.”</a> This provides an important bridge connecting diffeology to sheaf theory.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(2013): PIZ publishes the first (and currently only) textbook on diffeology, appropriately named <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Diffeology/Nb0xAAAAQBAJ?hl=en">“Diffeology.”</a> This helps attract a new generation of mathematicians to the subject.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(2010s): There is a huge influx of interest in diffeology. Papers are written about diffeology with connections to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3212">mathematical physics</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.3001">Lie groupoid theory</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.2871">foliations</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.6394">homotopy theory</a>, and more. Some particularly important papers are written in this period.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Two definitions of tangent spaces, the internal and external, are given for diffeological spaces in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5425">“Tangent Spaces and Tangent Bundles for Diffeological Spaces.”</a> by Christensen and Wu. They are shown to be isomorphic for manifolds, and agree with the usual definition of tangent space. They are shown not to agree in general, and many fascinating examples are given.</li>
      <li>A compactly generated model structure<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> is proven to exist for diffeological spaces by Kihara in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06794">“Model category for Diffeological Spaces.”</a> In order to make this model structure work, Kihara alters the diffeology on simplices.</li>
      <li>A deep study of diffeological vector spaces is made in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07564">“Diffeological Vector Spaces”</a> by Christensen and Wu. Many new fascinating examples of misbehaving diffeological spaces are given.</li>
    </ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>(2021): Out of the pandemic sprouts the Monthly Global Diffeology Seminar and a website hub <a href="https://diffeology.net/">diffeology.net</a> for everything diffeology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(2020s): With the start of the new decade comes a newly energized and diverse community of diffeologists. Some notable papers are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12845">“Projective model structures on diffeological spaces and smooth sets and the smooth Oka principle”</a>, Pavlov settles in the negative a long-standing conjecture, he proves that there does not exist a model structure on diffeological spaces that is right transferred from the Kan-Quillen model structure on simplicial sets. Instead, he proves the existence of a right transferred model structure on all sheaves on \(\mathsf{Cart}\), which the category of diffeological spaces is a full subcategory of.</li>
      <li>Two important papers on diffeological groupoids are written, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09901">“Diffeological Morita Equivalence”</a> by van der Schaaf and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12730">“Bicategories of Diffeological Groupoids”</a> by Watts, providing a solid framework for future work generalizing Lie groupoid theory.</li>
      <li>In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02583">“Elastic Diffeological Spaces”</a> by Blohmann, a subclass of diffeological spaces, known as elastic diffeological spaces, is shown to admit a tangent category structure. This implies that elastic diffeological spaces have a Lie algebra structure on their set of vector fields, providing a “Cartan Calculus” for elastic diffeological spaces. This sets up a powerful framework for future work in symplectic geometry.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<ul>
  <li>(2023): PIZ finally publishes his paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11856-023-2486-8">“Cech-deRham bicomplex in diffeology”</a> on the Cech-deRham obstruction for diffeological spaces that was originally written in 1988.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></li>

      <p>However, Iglesias-Zemmour writes in his <a href="http://math.huji.ac.il/~piz/documents/AITD.pdf">Introduction to Diffeology</a> (where I obtained much of this history) that diffeological spaces were “built on the model” of Chen spaces. Later work by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0802.2225">Stacey</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0807.1704">Baez-Hoffnung</a> showed how Chen spaces are directly comparable to diffeological spaces. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>I can’t help but mention that at the time of writing, there are four different versions of Cech cohomology for diffeological spaces in the literature. Indeed, there is PIZ’s, defined in his paper above. There is Krepski, Watts and Wolbert’s diffeological Cech cohomology given in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01032">“Sheaves, principal bundles, and Čech cohomology for diffeological spaces”</a>. There is my version of Cech cohomology for diffeological spaces defined in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11023">“Diffeological Principal Bundles and Principal Infinity Bundles”</a> which is called \(\infty\)-stack cohomology. Finally there is Ahmadi’s version of diffeological Cech cohomology given in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03251">“Diffeological Cech Cohomology.”</a> It is currently an open question as to whether any of these cohomologies agree for all diffeological spaces. <a href="#fnref:3" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

This is the main subject of study in my PhD research, and will be the topic of my thesis. So in this post, I want to answer the question “What the hell is a diffeological space, and why should I care?”</p>

<p>Okay, so that’s actually two questions, and I will handle the second one (“why should I care?”) first. There are actually many different ways to approach this question, and rather than list a bunch of them, I’ll pick one for this post.</p>

<p>So imagine you are a differential geometer. Your research revolves around finite dimensional smooth manifolds, well behaved mathematical objects with a long history (something like 200 years) of study. You know that whatever tools you need, there will be something in the enormous toolbox of classical differential geometry to suit your needs. Hell, partitions of unity probably get you most of the way.</p>

<p>One day you come across some kind of smooth space, maybe a group of diffeomorphisms, or possibly an orbifold of some kind, which is not a finite dimensional smooth manifold! You want to prove some theorems about this misbehaving space, but when you flip through your textbooks on classical differential geometry, there’s nothing! All of its theorems are about finite dimensional smooth manifolds. You glance over at the dusty tome on your shelf about Banach manifolds, with its hundreds of pages of hardcore functional analysis, and cower in fear.</p>

<p>Okay, maybe that’s a little dramatic. But its something that happens all the time in differential geometry. The truth is, modern differential geometry wishes to study all kinds of crazy spaces that are not finite dimensional smooth manifolds. Yet, the way these crazy spaces are usually dealt with is in an ad hoc manner, and sometimes require lots of functional analysis. When a new kind of crazy space comes along, and we wish to study it, none of the tools we’ve developed thus far will help us. We need to redefine all the concepts of differential geometry we’d like to use on this new kind of crazy space.</p>

<p>Diffeology is a new, modern framework for differential geometry that says “enough is enough, we need a big box of smooth spaces that includes manifolds and all kinds of crazy spaces us modern differential geometers care about, and we need a uniform way of reasoning about these spaces, and extending our old theorems to them.” This might sound like wishful thinking. What mathematics will guide us in this new world, far out from our cozy land of Euclidean spaces and tori? That tool is <strong>Category Theory</strong>.</p>

<p>You’ve probably heard about category theory already if you are looking at this blog, so I won’t bother trying to explain what it is, as any attempts by myself to do so would probably be embarassing anyway. Why category theory matters here is because there is a category staring us in the face. That category is \(\mathsf{Man}\), the category whose objects are finite dimensional smooth manifolds and whose morphisms are smooth functions between them.</p>

<p>This category <strong>sucks</strong>!</p>

<p>Indeed, the category \(\mathsf{Man}\) has finite products, transverse pullbacks and a few colimits (but noticeably not any coproducts between manifolds of different dimension!). This is not enough for the working category theorist or really for the working geometer. We want to glue things together willy-nilly, like for instance, this is my favorite example, take two copies of the real line, and glue them together at the origin. We’ll call this space the Axes.</p>

<div align="center">

  <figcaption>Figure 2: Axes, the result of gluing two copies of \(\mathbb{R}\) at the origin.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>This is not a manifold! If it were, then it would be the colimit of the following diagram in \(\mathsf{Man}\).</p>

\[0 \rightrightarrows \mathbb{R} \sqcup \mathbb{R},\]

<p>where each map is the inclusion of the origin into either the left or right copy of \(\mathbb{R}\). But c’mon now, this is a simple space! We should be able to have the usual concepts of differential geometry (tangent spaces, bundles, deRham cohomology, etc.) apply to this thing!</p>

<p>Diffeology is an attempt to do just this. It provides us with a category, \(\mathsf{Diff}\), whose objects are diffeological spaces, which is complete, cocomplete, and locally presentable. If you don’t know what that means exactly, don’t worry about it. The point is that it is a wayyy better category than \(\mathsf{Man}\), it lets us glue stuff together however we like. Our friend the Axes is an object in this category, as are all finite dimensional smooth manifolds, and thus the diagram above can be considered in \(\mathsf{Diff}\), and its colimit is precisely Axes!</p>

<p>This was a super rough, motivational post. I’ll be back next time to delve into some more motivation and some of the history of diffeological spaces.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="math" /><category term="diffeological_spaces" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The inaugural post!
