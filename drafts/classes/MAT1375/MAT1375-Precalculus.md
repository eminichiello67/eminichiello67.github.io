**Course Information:** Precalculus is the study of functions. Functions are one of the most important concepts in all of mathematics, and here you'll be introduced to a whole bunch of different kinds: linear, polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, etc. Functions are important because they model relationships in the real world. We're going to use [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/), a free, online graphing calculator to help us visualize functions.

**Homework:** I will not be collecting homework, but students should be expected to present their solutions to the class at the start of the next lecture.

**Student Wellness:** We all experience stressful and difficult events as a normal part of life. As your instructor, I
believe your mental health is an important part of your academic success. Success in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Be sure to check out the [Student Wellness Center](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/wellness-center/) and CityTech's [Counseling Services](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/counseling/).

**Academic Integrity:**
The instructor of the course has the authority to give a grade of F if the student submits the work of another person in a manner that
represents their work, or knowingly permits one’s work to be submitted by another person without the instructor’s permission. For further information see the [NYCCT Student Handbook](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/current-student/docs/StudentHandbook.pdf), pages 95-99.
