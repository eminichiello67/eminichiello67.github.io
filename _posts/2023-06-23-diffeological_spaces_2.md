Let's dive into the history of diffeological spaces. 

* First, some prehistory: In 1973, Kuo-Tsai Chen wrote a [paper](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1970846?origin=crossref) where he introduced Chen spaces, a class of smooth spaces very similar to diffeological spaces, for the purpose of proving a "loop space deRham Theorem" (his words). This Theorem states that one can calculate the cohomology of the loop space of a manifold using a technique called "iterated integrals." The important point here is being to define differential forms on the loop space of a manifold, which is almost never a finite dimensional smooth manifold.
