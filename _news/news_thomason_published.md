Some nice news, my paper [Thomason-Type Model Structures on Simplicial Complexes and Graphs](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10485-026-09850-6) has been published by Applied Categorical Structures! At the same time, my new paper [Hypercovers in Differential Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11971) has hit the arXiv!
