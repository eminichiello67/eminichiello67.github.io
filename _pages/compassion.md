I subscribe to the belief that we need more compassion in mathematics. Whether that be in the form of giving more compassionate talks, being more aware of the effects of mental health, or being more inclusive of minority groups of all kinds.

Below I give some links that I think are really important to this idea.

* [Rethink Math Talks](https://topos.site/blog/2024-08-02-rethink-math-talks/)

* [Mental Health in the Mathematics Community](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201907/rnoti-p1079.pdf)

### Organizations and Groups
* [AWM](https://awm-math.org/) - Association for Women in Mathematics,
* [Spectra](https://lgbtmath.org/) - The Association for LGBTQ+ Mathematicians,
* [ENYGMMA](https://sites.google.com/stonybrook.edu/enygmma/home) - Empowering New York Gender Minority Mathematicians

If you know of any other resources for compassionate mathematics, let me know.
