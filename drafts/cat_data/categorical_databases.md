The purpose of this page is to collect and organize some of the vast literature on categorical database theory, which I define to be anything within the intersection of category theory and database theory. 

There are many papers on categorical database theory, but two research programs stand out in particular: the Functorial Data Model of Spivak, Wisnesky and the EASIK (Sketch Data Model) of Rosebrugh, Johnson et al.


This list was helped out a ton by these [slides]("codd1970.pdf) by Robert Rosebrugh.

Database theory proper starts with:
* Codd, (1970) [A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~zives/03f/cis550/codd.pdf).

A decade later, the view-update problem is formalized in Bancilhon, Spyratos (1981) [Update semantics of relational views](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/319628.319634). This would inspire much work on [lenses](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/lens+%28in+computer+science%29), a history of which is given [here](https://julesh.com/2018/08/16/lenses-for-philosophers/) by Jules Hedges. An influential early paper on the subject is Bohannon, Pierce and Vaughan (2006) [Relational Lenses:A Language for Updatable Views](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/papers/dblenses-pods.pdf).


The Rosebrugh, Johnson Program:
* 
Johnson, Rosebrugh (2002) - [Sketch Data Models, Relational Schema and
Data Specification](https://www.mta.ca/~rrosebru/articles/sdmrsds.pdf). Compares the Relational Model and the Sketch Data Model. Compares the "data specficiations" Sketches model of Piessens-Steegmans and the Sketch Data Model.


The Spivak-Wisnesky Program:

* Spivak, (2009) [Simplicial Databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.2012).

* Spivak, (2010) [Table manipulation in simplicial databases](https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.2682).

* Spivak, (2010) [Functorial data migration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1009.1166).
  
* Spivak, (2012) [Kleisli Database Instances](https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1011).
