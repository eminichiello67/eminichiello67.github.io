Hello!

My name is Emilio Minichiello (he/him), I am a mathematician based in New York City. I like to apply category theory to other areas of mathematics and science, like differential geometry and database theory.

Currently, I am an Assistant Professor in the [Mathematics department](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/mathematics/#) at [CUNY CityTech](https://www.citytech.cuny.edu/). 

Before that I was a pure mathematics PhD student at the CUNY Graduate Center, studying the intersection of category theory and differential geometry. My PhD thesis was [Higher Diffeology Theory](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/5759/), applying homotopical and categorical methods to [diffeological spaces](https://math.huji.ac.il/~piz/documents/AITD.pdf). My advisor was [Mahmoud Zeinalian](https://www.zeinalian.com/). 

During the last year of my PhD I also worked part-time at [Conexus AI](https://conexus.com/) studying [Categorical Database Theory](https://www.categoricaldata.net/).

The best way to reach me is by email [eminichiello67@gmail.com](mailto:eminichiello67@gmail.com).
